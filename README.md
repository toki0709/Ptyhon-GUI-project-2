# Ptyhon-Gui-Tkinter

My project for GUI to calculate harmonics for electrical power transmission. I have used the pandas, numpy and matploblib for data visualization. Firstly, I have cleaned 
the data for this puspose. Lastly, this should give the preliminary idea how the GUI should look like and also fetching data from database can also be implemented.
